<h1>Capstone Banking App</h1>

<h2>Description/Motivation</h2> <br>
This was the capstone assignment for the MIT full stack bootcamp. We were tasked with creating a banking app that included a bootstrap navbar, pages such as create account, deposit, withdraw, balance, and all data.

<h2>Installation Guidelines</h2> <br>
Git Clone, npm init, install the dependencies, and run node index.js

<h2>Technology Used</h2> <br>
The MERN stack, including React, Express, Cors, and Dal.

<h2>Features</h2> <br>
Responsive navbar, animated gradient background, and functioning forms such as create account, login, and deposit. I would like to add/improve authentication and security, as well as make the card forms more responsive and centered.
